"""Append-only, hash-chained audit trail: one JSON line per outcome.

Every record carries `prev`: the SHA-256 of the previous line's exact bytes
(64 zeros for the first line). Editing, reordering, or deleting any line
except the very last one breaks the chain, and `verify()` reports the first
line where it breaks. Deleting the newest lines cannot be detected from the
file alone; anchor `tip()` somewhere the writer cannot reach if you need
that. The chain is unkeyed, so it is tamper-EVIDENT, not tamper-proof: an
attacker with write access could re-chain the whole file. That is the host
trust domain, which permitd does not defend against (THREAT_MODEL.md).

Best-effort by contract: logging must never raise into the dispatch path. A
gate that can't write its audit line still answers; it just loses that line,
and `dropped` counts how many it lost. JSONL on purpose — the trail stays
`tail -f`-able and trivially exportable.
